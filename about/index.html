			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>In August of 2014, I left Cedar Rapids for the University of Iowa, where I am currently studying Ethics and Public Policy along with Philosophy. I have worked on several political campaigns and am currently working on a predictive model for the Iowa Primaries. In my spare time, I like to read and climb things.</p>
